This program takes player stats spreasheets from Basketball Reference and predicts NBA outcomes. 
On line 28, change the file path to be a folder that contains the downloaded spreadsheets from Basketball-Reference. The stats should be per game stats for individual players. The leagueStats spreadsheet should be downloaded from the "Advanced Stats" category on basketball reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022.html). Columns for individual player stats should be sorted by minutes played.
